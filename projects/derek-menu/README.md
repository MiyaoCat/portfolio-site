# Vanilla JS app prototype practice area

These are for fun! You know, it's kinda nice to have some experience trying to build these things without a framework first. Luckily we have things like string templates and es modules now too. Get in there and make stuff. This isn't about best-practices and doing it "right" the first time. Enjoy the exploration. Who knows!, you might come up with a unique angle and build the next even better framework one day.

## get it going

1. clone the repo
2. open a terminal
3. navigate to the folder of the repo `cd projets/js-app-prototype` or something
4. `npm install`
5. this project uses Vite as the build-tool and live server
6. `npm run dev` will start the server

To stop the server, type `control + c`

(note the server will tell you the URL to visit / and you can click it)
