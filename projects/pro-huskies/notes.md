##Things I've learned

# .flat() method 
- turns nested array into single array
# .flat(Infinity) 
- turns multiple nested arrays [array, [nested array], array3] into single array
# Simple for...of loop
- If you have an array, string, NodeList etc you can loop through it.
- Composed like this: for (const element of array) { do something over each element }

# CSS - Flip card.
- rotating over Y axis. Pretend Y axis is in the middle. Rotating an element over its y-axis will move it from the left side to the right side or vice versa.


# get Attribute
- can get 'for', 'data-'

# Sort Years 
- Not quite the same as alphabetically. Needs a comparison:
(a, b) => b - a)

# Array.from
- Creates an Array from (Array.from) an iterable/array-like object.
- Creates a new array from array-like objects or anything that's iterable. In my case, the LI's of athlete-cards. Often used to transform something that's iterable into an array.

# while

- while (condition)
  statement
