We've always been told to build something toward a field we want to work in. Currently my interests lie in sports, fashion and web3 so I chose \"Luxury Streetwear\" to emulate as their sites were the most interesting. They had some unique layouts and I liked their clean, modern aesthetics."

They all employed very similar styles. They used only white and black and let their photos carry all of the color. They all included large images that sometimes covered the entire width of the screen to showcase their products and bring emotion to the site. <br><br>I also noticed they mostly used uppercase, sans-serif fonts. Below is the moodboard I created where I pulled different headers, fonts, images and visual treatments they used for my own inspiration."
