I've worked in tech most of my career, but I finally decided to make the transition into Web Development and Web Design because I wanted to be the one who actually builds the things. It's been a fun journey learning to code through the amazing program <a href='https://perpetual.education/' target='_blank'>Perpetual Education</a> (you can read about how I chose PE <a href='https://johnmiyao.substack.com/p/coming-soon?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2' target='_blank'>here</a>), but I know the learning is only getting started."

			"content": "<span class='attention-voice'>Why Web Development?</span><br> I've always loved solving problems and creating and Web Development allows me to explore both simultaneously. Over the past few years, I had dabbled in self-teaching programs, but I struggled staying committed so I sought out a program and landed on PE for it’s pace, emphasis on good design and our instructor/mentor, Derek Woods who truly cares about our success."

			"content": "<span class='attention-voice'>What do I do for fun?</span><br>Beyond tapping away at a keyboard and straining my eyes, I try to stay active through running, cycling or the occasional hike. I also love sports, particularly basketball and the NBA. I was born and raised in Sacramento so I’m cursed with being a Sacramento King’s fan. If I'm parked on the couch, I'm usually watching sports or scrolling on my phone or scrolling while watching sports.<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to get to know me.
