I've worked in tech most of my career, but this year (2022), I finally decided to make the transition into Web Development and Web Design. It's been a fun journey learning to code through the amazing program Perpetual Education (you can read about how I chose PE here), but I know it's only the beginning. <br><br> I've always loved solving problems and creating and Web Development allows for me to exercise my creativity while introducing challenging problems.<br><br>Beyond tapping away at a keyboard and straining my eyes, you can find me cycling, running, playing basketball or on the occasional hike. If I'm parked on the couch, I'm usually watching sports or scrolling or scrolling while watching sports.<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to get to know. Now holla atchyaboiii!"
