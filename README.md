# Welcome to my personal site! 

This site was built with PHP as it was the first language we learned. The pages are rendered with a lil' page router and of the content is pulled from JSON data files. I created each module and component globally. If I want to use a module or component, I can simply add it in the page's JSON file with it's associated content. This way, I only need to build the module/component once and adjust the content in the JSON file. If you visit the Style Guide, you can view each module.

Later on, I added some animations using GreenSock Application Platform, which is run on Javascript. I'm just scratching the surface, but it's fun to be able to make elements move across the page. You can also view my GSAP Layout project, which is my first introduction into GSAP. 

I also recommend checking out the Javascript forms as they're the latest mini projects I've completed.
