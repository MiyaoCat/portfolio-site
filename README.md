# Welcome to my personal site! 

This site was built with PHP as it was the first language we learned. The pages are rendered with a lil' page router and of the content is pulled from JSON data files. 

This is where you can learn a bit about me and see all of my finished projects.
I recommend checking out the Javascript forms as they're the latest mini projects I've completed.
